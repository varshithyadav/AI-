% hanoi(+N, +Start, +End, +Extra)
% This predicate represents the solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem.
% N: Number of disks
% Start: The starting peg
% End: The ending peg
% Extra: The auxiliary peg

hanoi(1, Start, End, _) :-
    format('Move disk from ~w to ~w~n', [Start, End]).

hanoi(N, Start, End, Extra) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    hanoi(M, Start, Extra, End),
    hanoi(1, Start, End, _),
    hanoi(M, Extra, End, Start).

output:
